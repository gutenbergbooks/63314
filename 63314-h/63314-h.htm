LETTER,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&amp;c.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>You have not stated the nature or the grounds of those
<i>scruples</i> which prevent your immediate adhesion to our
recently-formed association;&mdash;nor will I attempt to
conjecture what they may be; especially since you avow your
cordial approbation of every well-timed effort in defence of our
Protestant faith and liberties against the malignant aggressions
of Popery.&nbsp; I am not able to imagine any substantial
objection on the part of a truly Protestant mind.</p>
<p>Believing, as I firmly do believe, that our National Church is
founded on truth, and that the <i>Protestant ascendancy</i>
involves the temporal and spiritual welfare of the people of
these realms,&mdash;believing also that the agents and emissaries
of Popery have, for a series of years, been actively employed in
embroiling the affairs of this kingdom, with an ultimate view to
the restoration of the popish priesthood, together with their
dark superstitions and inhuman despotism,&mdash;believing that
new and unwonted energies must be called into action, in defence
of our national religion, or that, by secret undermining and open
assault, &ldquo;our holy and beautiful house where our fathers <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>worshipped&rdquo; will soon be levelled with the dust,
&ldquo;and all our pleasant things laid waste,&rdquo;&mdash;I
hail the formation of the Protestant Association as a propitious
event, and deliberately, from the religious conviction that I am
in the path of duty, enrol my name as a member.</p>
<p>In stating thus freely my own forcible impressions, I disclaim
any intention of impugning the motives of those who are not,
equally with myself, convinced of the expediency or utility of
this association.&nbsp; Whatever may be the ground of <i>your</i>
hesitation, I have entire confidence in the purity and integrity
of your principles.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, allow me to say, with deference, that your
indecision, in this case, does not for a moment cause me to waver
in my own convictions, since I cannot but suspect that your
doubts originate in an imperfect conception of the perils to
which our religion and our country are exposed.&nbsp; Were these
dangers of less appalling magnitude, I also should have strong
scruples against this or any similar association.&nbsp; They are
justifiable on no other ground than that of absolute
necessity.&nbsp; They bring with them many incidental
evils.&mdash;They lead into collision adverse parties, and
produce impassioned controversies; they create evils which no man
can be right in abetting, even indirectly, but with a view to
ward off others which are more injurious to the public
welfare.&nbsp; Besides which, no man of feeling would rashly
hazard the obloquy which will be cast upon him by his opponents
in this age of low-minded invective and scurrilous
defamation.&nbsp; Nor is it a small evil to <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>lose the
favourable regards of upright and conscientious persons who take
an opposite view of the exigencies and the duties of the
times.&nbsp; For myself, I have no sickly ambition for this
species of martyrdom.&nbsp; I sacrifice with painful reluctance
the esteem of the wise and the good, from whom it is my
misfortune, at any time, to be separated by conflicting opinions
and irreconcileable interests.&nbsp; But there are occasions
which call for higher duties than those of conciliation or
friendship,&mdash;when private affections must be merged in a
holy patriotism, and when the strength of our principles must be
proved, not by the extinction of our finer
sensibilities,&mdash;God forbid!&mdash;but by their yielding,
with whatever bitterness of grief, to a commanding sense of <span
class="smcap">Duty</span>.&nbsp; I am strongly impressed with the
conviction, that such an occasion presents itself in &ldquo;this
day of <i>trouble</i>, and of <i>rebuke</i>, and of
<i>blasphemy</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far from having my own apprehensions allayed by the numbers of
those who are insensible to the pressure of great and imminent
danger, my fears are awakened by nothing so much as by that very
consideration; by no other fact am I so deeply convinced of the
extreme necessity of supporting the Protestant Association, as
one means, among others, of diffusing information, and thus
arousing in our countrymen a spirit of determined resistance to
Popery, corresponding with the power and the artifice of that
unrelenting adversary.</p>
<p>The policy of the Papists has ever been, to the last degree,
subtle, profound, and unscrupulous,&mdash;varying with the
changeful phases of society, <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and adapting itself with fiend-like
sagacity to the peculiar character of individuals and of
nations.&nbsp; But never did that policy show itself more
triumphantly than in the late rapid march of Popery towards a
paramount dominion in this kingdom; and in the skill, the
cunning, the profound strategy by which it has covered its
progress, lulling into false security the people of this betrayed
and devoted country.</p>
<p>I lay comparatively little stress on the number of converts
openly professing themselves to be proselytes to Popery: the
report may be exaggerated or it may not.&nbsp; I am not startled,
as some are, by the increase of popish chapels, monasteries, and
colleges.&nbsp; I fear nothing from the open teachers of popish
doctrine, nor would I enter into a <i>fiddle faddle</i>
controversy with a Jesuitical priesthood, who are not bound by
the laws of honourable warfare, and who, when defeated in
argument, always take refuge in their insolent assumption of
<i>infallibility</i>.&nbsp; The naked dogmas of Popery carry with
them their own refutation.&nbsp; They originated in the dark ages
of barbarian ignorance and public confusion, when the Roman
empire had been swept by the northern hordes, and savage warfare
left no leisure, no disposition, to cultivate those departments
of knowledge which expand and invigorate the human mind.&nbsp;
Popery can never make converts in an enlightened nation like
England, but from among the most feeble in intellect or sordid in
character, the uninstructed vulgar, nervous women, or
intellectual profligates.&nbsp; True, she has advocates both
subtle and learned; <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>but they are men who were cradled in her errors, and
whose early discipline and youthful associations&mdash;designed
for the suppression of the manly mind&mdash;have combined, with
the interested motives of after-life, to fix them in her
faith.&nbsp; I give no credit to the more notorious of popish
agitators for sincerity in their <i>religious</i> attachment to
the cause they serve.&nbsp; Popery is their stepping-stone to
distinction and power.&nbsp; They laugh in their sleeve at that
lucrative fable while they derive power, as political
incendiaries, from the distresses and <i>superstitions</i> of an
abject people.</p>
<p>But while naked Popery is simply despicable for its
absurdities or detestable for its intolerance, I fear every thing
from the unwearied and versatile genius of <i>Romish policy</i>,
which, without having proselyted to the popish faith Protestant
England, has contrived, by a series of man&oelig;uvres, so to
dislocate the frame of British society, that instead of combining
to crush, as they might easily do, the common foe, Protestant is
arrayed against Protestant, while the only party really to be
dreaded by all, is looked upon without suspicion and without
fear.&nbsp; If the present course of events is suffered to
proceed,&mdash;while one class of Protestants is tamely looking
on, and another section is actively and zealously employed in
seconding the designs of the papacy,&mdash;I see no impossibility
that is to prevent the entire power of the State from falling, at
no distant period, into the hands of the popish faction.&nbsp;
And what use they will make of that power is not a matter of
difficult conjecture.&nbsp; History is <i>not</i> &ldquo;an old
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>almanack,&rdquo; unless to fools and desperadoes; and
history denounces papal intolerance in characters of horror and
of blood.</p>
<p>Allow me to repeat it,&mdash;for this is the very gist of the
argument,&mdash;from naked and avowed Popery little was to be
feared; but from Popery carrying on its wily projects through the
means of <i>Protestant agency</i>, or, under Protestant colours,
conducting a piratical warfare, every thing is to be
dreaded.&nbsp; And this is exactly the way in which we are now
assailed.</p>
<p>If you look to the <span class="smcap">State</span>, you
behold the ministers of a Protestant Queen, who are sworn to
uphold the Protestant religion, bound hand and foot by popish
demagogues and traitorous agitators, and impotent to carry any
great measure against the assent of their masters, who can on any
day effect their dismissal from office.&nbsp; Their policy is
entirely popish.&nbsp; The Privy Council is thrown open to popish
intrigue; the army is largely recruited from the popish peasantry
of Ireland; popish bishops are appointed and salaried by
government in the colonies; the popish faction holds the balance
of parties in the Commons house of Parliament.</p>
<p>The aspect of the <span class="smcap">Church</span> is
scarcely less alarming.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Oxford Tracts&rdquo; are
said to represent the sentiments of a considerable number of our
devout clergy and laity.&nbsp; Of these very remarkable
productions, enforcing the practices of a superstitious devotion,
and denouncing, with a papistical jealousy of free enquiry, every
manly exercise of the human mind, when religion is the <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>subject of
investigation, it is sufficient to say that they have been read
with grief and astonishment by many of the most sound divines of
the Anglican Church, and hailed by papists with a sneer of
triumph.&nbsp; For the principles of the Protestant faith, they
are by far</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Too ceremonious
and traditional.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, if the spirit of servile superstition which some of these
tracts breathe,&mdash;if the gloomy intolerance they
sanction,&mdash;can be shown to harmonize with the doctrines and
usages of our Church, <i>dissent</i> needs no better
vindication.&nbsp; Happily these noxious principles are the
growth of another soil; but they who embrace them are not far
from the worst dogmas of Popery.&nbsp; They are already in the
vestibule&mdash;a few more steps will carry them to the altar of
that desecrated temple.&nbsp; It has been suggested, and the
suggestion is not at variance with Christian courtesy and
candour, that these Tracts have originated in a Jesuitical
conspiracy to pollute the stream of orthodox truth at the
fountain head.&nbsp; Looking only at the <i>internal</i>
evidence, the suspicion is fully justified.&nbsp; At any rate,
they prepare the way in a manner most satisfactory to the
Papists, for a close alliance with the apostate church, whose
spirit and whose errors they so nearly resemble.&nbsp; They are
indefensible as the productions of Protestant divines.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will pronounce this opinion arrogant and harsh,
considering who are the writers.&nbsp; But in a case such as the
present the public have a right <i>to judge the work itself</i>,
<i>independently of the </i><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span><i>writers</i>, of whose individual
characters few readers can be supposed to know any thing.&nbsp; I
judge as one of the public,&mdash;I look at the
&ldquo;Tracts&rdquo; apart from their authors, and my conviction
is, that no personal worth, no amiable qualities, no piety, no
erudition can vindicate the estimable authors of these
&ldquo;Tracts&rdquo; from having done, with whatever purity of
intention, great injury to the Protestant cause.&nbsp; Here is
Popery, indirectly at least, promoted by the professors of a
university, whose name has hitherto been regarded as the symbol
of pure orthodoxy.&nbsp; The times are fearful when the whisper
goes forth, even among the most devoted friends of the
church&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Popery at Oxford</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; From
another section of churchmen, scarcely less danger is to be
apprehended: they are smoothing the way for popish
ascendancy.&nbsp; I mean those whose <i>ultra-liberalism</i>
embraces every interest but that of their own
communion&mdash;whose latitudinarian candour regards with
complacency every erroneous form of doctrine or worship, as if,
all that we tolerate we were bound in duty to approve,&mdash;who
look with special favour on every deviation from the sound
orthodoxy of the church,&mdash;who hail <i>every irregularity</i>
as a commendable exercise of freedom,&mdash;and who reserve their
censures and their frowns for those who conscientiously adhere to
&ldquo;<i>the good old way</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; By this anomalous
order of churchmen&mdash;the growth of modern days&mdash;all the
assailants of the sacred cause are held in honour for their
presumed freedom from prejudice,&mdash;all its defenders are
condemned as mercenaries or bigots.&nbsp; Of this description of
persons, <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>it may be presumed, many are prepared to sit down, quite
at ease, under the <i>mild</i> sovereignty of the papacy.&nbsp;
Their special predilection for that <i>persecuted</i> race of
patriots and Christians, who are agitating for an Italian despot
and the Holy Inquisition, is only preparatory to their own sworn
allegiance to Rome, the moment that haughty power obtains
dominion and can command submission.&nbsp; They are waiting for
the flood-tide.&nbsp; To say the least, the men whose liberalism
can rejoice in Popery, can have no motives for becoming martyrs
to Protestant truth and liberty.</p>
<p>And now let us look at <span class="GutSmall">THE COUNTRY AT
LARGE</span>.&nbsp; Judging from the tone of our popular
literature, and from the spirit of the public press, which can
only subsist by responding to the sentiments of the day, I cannot
but think that infidelity and profligacy abound to an alarming
extent among the reading classes.&nbsp; The Protestant church, it
is plain, can have no hold on the disciples of Voltaire, of Hume,
of Gibbon, of Paine, of Byron.&nbsp; She will never compromise
her pure morality.&nbsp; In the bosom of the Mother of Harlots
they may revel with impunity: <i>confession</i>, and
<i>absolution</i>, and <i>extreme unction</i>, will reconcile
them to her ascendancy.&nbsp; Among the paradoxes of the human
mind, none is more common than the junction of profane scepticism
with credulous superstition,&mdash;the impious reviler of the
Bible making his last peace with heaven by taking his
<i>viaticum</i> from a popish priest.&nbsp; Popery is the
religion for all men who would indulge the hope of heaven, after
doing their utmost to convert the present world <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>into a hell
of impiety and crime.&nbsp; Already they are in political
alliance with the man of sin.</p>
<p>But there are others of less discreditable character than
these, from whom the Protestant cause derives no aid in this day
of trial.&nbsp; I mean that large class of easy, worthy,
unsuspecting persons who have imbibed unguardedly the sentiments
of modern liberalism, without its malignity, and in ignorance of
its designs.&nbsp; They see Popery only in the mild and subdued
form which it puts on while restrained by the usages and the laws
of a Protestant community.&nbsp; They find nothing in their
popish neighbours but what is humane and social, and, perhaps,
intelligent, honourable, and devout; and, reasoning from what
they see and hear themselves, they give credit to the idle tale
that <span class="smcap">Popery</span> is <span
class="GutSmall">REGENERATED</span>,&mdash;that the lion is
become a lamb, and the serpent a dove,&mdash;and that, under the
future reign of the Papacy, no longer perfidious, intolerant,
sanguinary, no materials will be supplied for another &ldquo;Book
of Martyrs&rdquo;&mdash;let it therefore take its unmolested
course!</p>
<p>Add to these, many persons of aristocratic rank and fortune,
whose principles are wavering, and who, on supposition that the
Church of England must fall a prey to the motley gang of modern
revolutionists, are prepared rather to side with Popery, which is
essentially aristocratical and monarchical, than with Protestant
dissent, which is plebeian, levelling and democratical.&nbsp;
They know that the pretended liberalism of Popery means nothing
more than that &ldquo;<i>she stoops to conquer</i>;&rdquo; <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and they will
prefer her custody of their titles and estates, to that of a
national convention of chartists or roundheads.</p>
<p>And now, my dear Sir, if this is not a mistaken view of
things, we are led to an appalling conclusion.&nbsp; If the
popish faction, ever vigilant while others sleep, should succeed,
by a <i>coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i>, in grasping the power of
the Executive government, they have so stealthily and
successfully prepared for the event, that a large mass of the
professedly Protestant community would hail their accession to
power; other important bodies would be so far neutralized as to
offer no resistance; while the portion of our church and nation
who remain &ldquo;faithful among the faithless&rdquo; will have
to maintain a conflict for truth and righteousness, under
circumstances of fearful inequality.&nbsp; I need not suggest
what the power of the state <i>can do</i>, when wielded by men of
unscrupulous principles, and devoted to their cause with the zeal
of a morbid superstition.</p>
<p>I do not say that this catastrophe is inevitable; but it is
not impossible.&nbsp; The mine is prepared although it may not be
sprung: but if the match should be applied, the explosion will be
far more tremendous, and the desolation more complete, than even
the &ldquo;Gunpowder Treason&rdquo; would have caused, if
Providence had not detected that most foul conspiracy.&nbsp; The
authors of that crime would have fallen, at once, victims to
popular indignation; but the conspirators of the present day will
have secured themselves from instant destruction by previously
tampering with the public mind, <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and corrupting its principles.&nbsp;
They have already carried Popish objects by Protestant agents;
and when the real combat is at length to be fought, <i>pro aris
et focis</i>, the dupes of their insidious policy will find
themselves unarmed or in confusion on the field of battle.</p>
<p>We may smile at popish miracles&mdash;the chapel at
Loretto&mdash;the blood of St. Januarius&mdash;the healing art of
the Abb&eacute; Paris&mdash;and all the low trumpery by which the
pretended vicar of Jesus Christ stoops to deceive and destroy:
but here is a master-stroke of policy, all but really miraculous,
displaying not less of satanic skill than malice, and at sight of
which the stoutest of British hearts may for a moment
quail.&nbsp; The events of these times will supply our posterity
with the most humiliating page in the history of their
country&mdash;Great Britain, invincible in arms, disorganized and
convulsed by the infernal arts of the Jesuits!</p>
<p>These dangers must be met by extraordinary measures of
defence.&nbsp; If the government did its duty, not a Jesuitical
institute would be suffered to pollute the land: these agents and
subjects of a foreign power would not be allowed to tamper with
the peace and the liberties of England.&nbsp; But, deserted by
the government, itself enslaved by an ignoble faction, and
powerful only for mischief, we must look to our own resources,
and, among others, to the <i>Protestant Association</i>.&nbsp; I
see nothing in its constitution or principles to justify the
fear, that it may not hopefully look for the blessing of Almighty
God upon its exertions.&nbsp; It has not been instituted by a
section or party in the church.&nbsp; It <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>overlooks
minor distinctions, and enrols among its members persons of every
shade of sentiment or opinion, who are willing to make a common
cause on behalf of our venerable church and our holy
religion.&nbsp; The moment it is made the instrument of party,
let it fall!&nbsp; The name of the Noble Lord who is its
president, is a pledge that its objects are truly British; and
the clergy and laity who are its members, can have <i>united</i>
for no purposes less holy than the preservation of that sacred
light which Popery had extinguished&mdash;which the reformers
re-kindled&mdash;and which, by God&rsquo;s grace, shall never
again be put out in England.</p>
<p>In looking at the aspect of the times, I am not sanguine in my
hopes, nor do I yield to despondency.&nbsp; It is ours to do our
duty, and leave the consequences with the Great Arbiter of human
destinies.&nbsp; If we are disappointed in our efforts to save
our country, we shall have the consolation of having made a stand
under circumstances which required some degree of moral courage,
and a lively faith in the God of Truth, whose servants we are,
and in whose cause it will be no dishonour to fall.</p>
<p>In the mean time, it is a reflection not to be evaded, however
painful to indulge, that great national guilt could alone have
reduced us to the embarrassments and perplexities of these
times&mdash;times of degeneracy so rapid and infatuation so
blind, that to this tormented kingdom may be applied the fearful
description of the historian of the Roman empire:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;Labente deinde paullatim disciplin&acirc;, velut
desidentes primo mores sequatur animo; deinde ut magis magisque
lapsi sint; tum ire c&oelig;perint pr&aelig;cipites:&mdash;donec
ad h&aelig;c tempora, quibus <i>nec vitia nostra</i>, <i>nec
remedia pati possumus</i>, perventum est.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now, my dear sir, I have acted upon my own convictions of
duty in thus plainly stating my motives for upholding the
Protestant Association: judge them as severely as you
please.&nbsp; They have at least this claim to calm
consideration: they are the reasons of an individual whose
personal interests and prospects would have dictated another
course of action, but who deems it his greatest happiness to have
his fortunes blended, &ldquo;for better or for worse,&rdquo; with
that hallowed cause in which Latimer and Ridley and Hooper and
Cranmer died.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
